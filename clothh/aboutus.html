<h>A LEAP OF FAITH</h>
<p>It was in 2012 that our founder adita Nayar left behind a lucrative, 18-year-long career in investment banking to satisfy an entrepreneurial itch. What resulted was a burgeoning business that changed the way women buy beauty in the country forever. Her approach that continually kept the customer at its core, swiftly amassed 18 million loyal followers who then urged us to craft an experience just as exciting in fashion.</p>
